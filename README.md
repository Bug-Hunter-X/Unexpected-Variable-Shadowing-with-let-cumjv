This example demonstrates a common JavaScript issue involving block scoping with the `let` keyword.  The inner `let x` declaration creates a new variable that's only accessible within the `if` block, shadowing the outer `x`. This can lead to confusing behavior if you're not aware of how block scoping works in JavaScript.  The solution shows how to avoid this issue by choosing more descriptive variable names.
